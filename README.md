# AVR_Drivers
in this repo u can find many drivers for atmega 32
they are arranged in folders about their layers 
if u want to use any driver from them just download its folder and read the header in folder to see the used functions in it
if it was in proplem in compiling it wil be about includes in the header file u have to include your other drivers in it instead of mine to compile with you
also u need to change the data types define as u do as an example i write it (uint8) another one can write it (UINT8) so change the undeclared varaibles in my driver to make it available for your usage
